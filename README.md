# Retail Platform (Portfolio Project)

This repository contains a **retail inventory management platform** built as a **microservices architecture** with Java 21 and Spring Boot 3.  
It is designed as a portfolio project to showcase best practices for modern backend development.

## Tech Stack
- **Java 21** (virtual threads, pattern matching, records where useful)
- **Spring Boot 3.5**
- **Hexagonal architecture (Ports & Adapters)**
- **API-first design** with OpenAPI 3
- **PostgreSQL** (via Docker Compose)
- **Kafka** (event-driven architecture, coming soon)
- **MongoDB** (for non-relational features, coming soon)
- **Testcontainers** for integration testing
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD
- **SonarCloud** for static analysis (to be added)
